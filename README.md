## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on heart disease fro Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritwikb3/heart-disease-statlog). There are 270 entries in the dataset. There are 13 attributes in this data set with one target variable. The target variable is labeled with either '0' no heart disease or '1' heart disease is detected. 

The 13 attributes are the following:
Age - Patient age in years
Sex - Gender of the Patient (Male: 1, Female: 0)
cp - type of chest pain experienced (0 : typical angina, 1 : atypical angina, 2 : non - anginal pain, 3: asymptomatic)
trestbps - patient's level of blood pressure at rest. 
chol - serum cholestrol
fbs - blood sugar lebels on fasting.
restecg - result of electrocardiogram while at rest (0: Normal, 1: having ST-T wave abnormality)
thalach- Max heart rate achieved.
exang - Angina induced by exercise (0 : no, 1: yes)
oldpeak - exercise induced ST-depression in relative with state of rest
slope - ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise.
ca - number of major blood vessels
thal - a blood disorder valled thalassmia

Questions to answer about dataset:

Is the dataset balanced?
The target variable labeled with 1 has 120 entries.
The target variable labeled with 0 has 150 entries.

I would consider this dataset to be relatively balanced. There is not an overwhelming amount of either 0 or 1. 

Any correlation between features?
